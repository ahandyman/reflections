When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Creating remote repo allows for variety of access of options.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  More control. Logical choice. Commit Message.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    forks - Modifying someone code using your github account 
    clone - Take the code to work locally
    branch - code experimentation  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Up to date with code. Avoide merge conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Create unique branches for different features. At this point I think mergring pushing and pulling are all still alittle confusing when collaborating. However with time I'm sure I'll pick it up
